# Introduction

ORM is an abstraction to the Object Relational Mapping technique that converts
data to and from a database into an object-oriented structure. It provides you
with means to define your Models (usually database tables), specifying Properties
(table columns) and helps you fetch Records (table rows) from database, updating
and saving them, without you needing to know what database type you're using
as the backend.

# Concepts

## Connecting

To begin using ORM, you just need to require the orm module and then connect to
your database. You do this using the database URI.

	var orm = require("orm");
	
	orm.connect("mysql://username:password@hostname/database", function (connected, db) {
		if (!connected) {
			return console.log("Could not connect!");
		}
		
		// we can now use `db`
	});


## Defining Models

To use ORM, you just need to define your Models very carefully. After you define
them according to your needs you can use the Model.sync to synchronize the table
structure on your database with your Model specifications. Please not that
synchronization will only happen for missing tables, not already created ones.


	var Person = db.define("person" {
		      "name": { "type": "string" },
		     "birth": { "type": "date "},
		      "male": { "type": "boolean" },
		"total_pets": { "type": "number" }
	});
	Person.sync(); // creates table `person` (if it does not exist)

You don't have to call sync every time you start your application. You just have to
do this once you need to create the tables on the database.

## Shorthands

Every property needs a type. There are aditional parameters you can define for each
property. For your convenience, if you don't have any parameters needed to set other
than the property type, you can use some shortcuts. Check the next example, doing
exactly the same as the previous one.

	var Person = db.define("person" {
		      "name": String,
		     "birth": Date,
		      "male": Boolean,
		"total_pets": Number
	});
	Person.sync(); // creates table `person` (if it does not exist)

There are more property types, like enumeration lists and even custom types.
